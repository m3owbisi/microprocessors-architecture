loop2:       ; Label for loop2 (outer loop)
    MOV A, M    ; Move the value from the memory location pointed to by HL to accumulator (A)
    ANI 01H    ; Perform a bitwise AND operation between A and 01H (hexadecimal 1)
    JNZ loop1   ; Jump to loop1 if the least significant bit (LSB) is 1 (odd value)
